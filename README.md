## Array Cardio

These challenges are to help train you in javascript arrays and methods with a sprinkling of DOM fun.

The challenges are broken into two parts focusing on different methods. The completed challenges are in a seperate branch called 'solutions'. 

Edit the files in the IDE of your choice, and then run and test your solutions in a browser console.
